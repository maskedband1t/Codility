	PROMPT:
		Scenario:
			A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. 
			The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y. 
			The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
			Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.	
		Conditions:
			X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
        		X â‰¤ Y.

		Write a function that:
			given three integers X, Y and D, 
			returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
